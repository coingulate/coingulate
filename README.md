## What is Coingulate?

Coingulate is more than just a word—it's a **mindset**, a **movement**, and a **memecoin** for hustlers, builders, and connectors who make things happen.

When you coingulate, you're not waiting for opportunities—you're creating them. You're reaching out to collaborators, leveraging your network, and using every tool at your disposal to turn ideas into reality.

## Etymology Breakdown

```
co-  +  ing  +  ulate
 │       │       │
 ↓       ↓       ↓
together  action  actively do/manage
```

**Together + Action + Actively Do = Coingulate**

To actively work with others, using connections & resources to **get it done!**
